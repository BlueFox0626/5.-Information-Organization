<p><strong>BLOC, INC.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Terms of Use Agreement</strong></p>

<p>This Agreement was last modified on July 19, 2016, and was first published and made effective on December 7, 2011.</p>

<p>Welcome to bloc.io, the website and online service of Bloc, Inc. (Bloc, we, or us). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, web site, and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the Service). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (Agreement) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the Bloc Privacy Policy <a href="privacy.html">https://www.bloc.io/privacy</a>, whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (Users).</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION.</p>

<p>Bloc may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement, we will update the last modified date at the top of this page. If there are material changes to this Agreement, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Our Service</strong></p>

<p>Bloc provides a place for beginners to learn how to program.</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>

<p>The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by Bloc.</p>

<p><strong>Bloc Accounts</strong></p>

<p>Your Bloc account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different types of Users. If you open a Bloc account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) you includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to Bloc with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>

<p>You may never use another User&#39;s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use strong passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Bloc immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Bloc will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your user profile settings page. By providing Bloc your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your user profile settings page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.</p>

<p><strong>Service Rules</strong></p>

<p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated scraping; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation robots, spiders, offline readers, etc., to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Bloc servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Bloc grants the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from Bloc.com for the sole purpose of and solely to the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii)transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.</p>

<p>We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

Bloc reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Bloc believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.

<p>Bloc may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.</p>

<p>To the best of your knowledge, all of your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.</p>

<p>Bloc takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.

<p><strong>User Content License Grant</strong></p>

<p>By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Bloc a royalty-free, sub-licensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and Blocs (and its successors and affiliates) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Service, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under this Agreement.</p>

<p>If the features of the Service allow you to remove or delete User Content from the Service, the above licenses granted by you in your User Content terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove or delete such User Content from the Service. You understand and agree, however, that Bloc may retain, but not display, distribute, or perform, server copies of User Content that have been removed or deleted. The above licenses granted by you in User Content for which the Service does not provide you a means to delete or remove are perpetual and irrevocable.</p>

<p><strong>CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICIES</strong></p>

<p><strong>STUDENT’S RIGHT TO CANCEL</strong>
1.      You have the right to cancel your agreement for a program of instruction, without any penalty or obligations, and receive a full refund within one week of your Program Start Date. After the end of the one week cancellation period, you also have the right to withdraw at any time; and you have the right to receive a pro rata refund if you have completed 60 percent or less of the scheduled hours in your program.</p>

<ol>
<li><pre><code>  Cancellation may occur when you provide a written notice of cancellation at the following address: 
</code></pre>

<p>Bloc, Inc.
Student Support and Operations
110 Sutter, 10th Floor
San Francisco, CA 94104  —OR—   email <a href="mailto:help@bloc.io">help@bloc.io</a>.  </p></li>
<li><p>The written notice of cancellation, if sent by mail, is effective when deposited in the mail properly addressed with proper postage.</p></li>
<li><p>The written notice of cancellation need not take any particular form and, however expressed, it is effective if it shows that you wish to withdraw. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>WITHDRAWAL FROM THE PROGRAM
You may withdraw from the school at any time after the cancellation period (described above) and receive a pro rata refund if you have completed 60 percent or less of the scheduled days in your program.  The refund will be less a registration or administration fee of $250.00 within 45 days of withdrawal.  If you have completed more than 60% of the period of attendance in the program for which you were charged, the tuition is considered earned and you will receive no refund.</p>

<p>For the purpose of determining a refund under this section, you shall be deemed to have withdrawn from a program of instruction when any of the following occurs:
·         You notify Bloc in writing of the withdrawal or as of the actual last date of your attendance, whichever is later.
·      Bloc terminates your enrollment for failure to maintain satisfactory progress; failure to abide by Bloc rules and regulations; absences in excess of maximum set forth by Bloc; and/or failure to meet financial obligations to Bloc.
·         You have failed to attend class for three (3) consecutive weeks.
·         You fail to return from a leave of absence.</p>

<p>For the purpose of determining the amount of the refund, the date of your withdrawal shall be deemed the last date of recorded attendance. The amount owed equals the daily charge for the program (total institutional charge, minus non-refundable fees, divided by the number of days in the program), multiplied by the number of days scheduled to attend, prior to withdrawal.  For the purpose of determining when the refund must be paid, you shall be deemed to have withdrawn at the end of three (3) consecutive weeks without attendance; however, the refund amount will be calculated using your actual last date logged in or last date of an academically-related activity, whichever is later. If you have completed more than 60% of the period of attendance for which you were charged, the tuition is considered earned and you will receive no refund. </p>

<p>If any portion of the tuition was paid from the proceeds of a loan or third party, the refund shall be sent to the lender or third party.  Any remaining amount shall be paid to the student.</p>

<p>If you have not completed your program within two years of your program Start Date (or four years for the 144-week Software Engineering Track), you will be dropped out of the program and will no longer be eligible for a refund.</p>

<p><strong>Payment Information; Taxes</strong> . All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Payments to Mentors</strong> . Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, Bloc shall remit payments due to you hereunder no later than thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month in which the applicable fees are received. Payment shall be in the form you select when you register for the Service, or as subsequently updated as permitted by the Service. Payments shall only be made in those months in which the amount due to you totals at least $20. Unpaid amounts due shall accrue until the next month in which the amount due is at least $20. Bloc reserves the right to withhold payment or charge back to your account any amounts otherwise due to us under this Agreement, or amounts due to any breach of this Agreement by you, pending Bloc’s reasonable investigation of such breach. To ensure proper payment, you are solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with your account, which includes without limitation applicable tax information. If we believe that we are obligated to obtain tax information and you do not provide this information to us after we have requested it, we may withhold your payments until you provide this information or otherwise satisfy us that you are not a person or entity from whom we are required to obtain tax information. Any third-party fees related to returned or cancelled payments due to a contact or payment information error or omission may be deducted from the newly issued payment. You agree to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with your participation in the Service. If you dispute any payment made hereunder, you must notify Bloc in writing within thirty (30) days of such payment. Failure to so notify Bloc shall result in the waiver by you of any claim relating to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Bloc. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Bloc or have any effect under this Agreement. We may withhold any taxes or other amounts from payments due to you as required by law.</p>

You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, California or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration</strong> . In the unlikely event that Bloc has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Bloc claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, Claims), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in the city of San Francisco, California under the commercial rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorney’s fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Bloc from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Blocs proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND BLOC ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
